resource acquisition is initialization (C++)
===

The basic idea is to represent a resource by a local object (i.e. "resource handle"), so that the local object's destructor will release the resource.

This prevents resource leakage, because the destructor of "resource handle" will always be called. 

We can think of `vector` or `string` as resource handles with carefully crafted interfaces of a "list" (to facilitate user access and resource management.) 

Smart pointers are resource handles for the pointers they protect. Pointer gets deleted inside the destructor. Any API design should assume client can forget to `delete` a pointer, or `delete` it multipled times. So better not to expose any pointer (aka leadable resource) to users.

```cpp
	class File_handle {
		FILE* p;
	public:
		File_handle(const char* n, const char* a)
			{ p = fopen(n,a); if (p) throw Open_error(errno); }
		File_handle(FILE* pp)
			{ p = pp; if (p) throw Open_error(errno); }

		~File_handle() { fclose(p); }

		operator FILE*() { return p; }

		// ...
	};

	void f(const char* fn)
	{
		File_handle f(fn,"rw");	// open fn for reading and writing
		// use file through f
		// when this f() ends, the file access session gets closed.
	}
```

Thanks to garbage collection, Java doesnâ€™t have/need this feature.

In Golang, `defer` makes sure the resources get released after a function returns.
