# Compile >> Runtime

It helps to detect flaws earlier; a compile error is way better than an runtime error.

Go lang has strict requirement for types -- one reason why programmer makes less mistakes using Go in general.
Code won't compile if type does not match.

Maybe, between compile and runtime, static initialization sits in the middle.
Static initialization happens before `main()` so that a program won't start up if certain constraint is not satisfied.
